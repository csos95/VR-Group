## file structure and naming guidelines for rooms
All models are stored in the models folder.
Models for a room go in the room that they were created for
When you begin work on a room, create a folder for it in the models folder
naming is bo-[room number]
ex: models/bo-119
Naming for models is bo-[room number]-[object]
ex: bo-119-desk
Create a folder named textures in the folder for a room and store the textures inside of it
After you are finished creating a model and texturing it, export it in .fbx format.
This ensures that measurements and materials will be applied correctly when imported into Unity.
