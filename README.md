# VR-Group

This is the repository for the Midwestern State University Research Project.

The goal of the project is to fully model Bolin Hall (the building the computer science department is in) so that it can be traversed and explored using a virtual reality headset (oculus rift is what we user, but it should work with vive).

If you are working on the project and need help with basic git commands, please check the wiki.
